## Backlog V 2.1

- FIX: Error when trying to view test details of "The test will fail and should still get a report When I throw an assertion" (firefox) - "Cannot read property location of undefined"
- Performance logs: Mark cached requests
- BUG: Screenshot diff: Screenshot compare must also drill down into stack
- Make report API_URL configurable
- Fix source code view (scrolling)
- Alert Service: Filter alertable tests using a specific tag (e. g. could send alerts only for smoke tests)
- Browserlogs: Higher resolution of timestamps
- Test Details: Bring back the screenshot gallery view
- Test Details: Show full date in history popovers
- Test Error: Show breadcrumb path of error (test -> page obj -> action)
- Well known Tags: When test is tagged as @failing don't show it in "failed recently"
- Well known Tags: @ATDD:<storyid>:<lineno>: Hide ATDD tests from "failed recently" as long as the test fails on the specified line in the test
- Test Details: Show all errors in annotated source view

- IDEA Add a mini-thumbnail bar (filmstrip) to quickly navigate between screenshots
- Improve Source Code View: COllapse areas without annotations
- Should see the step outline from the list view
- PRB There might be a stacktrace without a test stackframe (see "When I login with city missing Then I see my data in best sso view")
- report details: Show list of tracking requests made during test run
- report not showing ALL reports (http://veve-dev-test-01.intern.v.check24.de:4000/tests?ownerkey=sIzM3ZEHRb&project=%23All)
- codeceptjs: report not grouping same test in different projects correctly

- Enhance alerting: Dont send alert if last test run has been successful
- Enhance alerting: Add all failing tests to report
- Enhance alerting: Show times of all test failures

- Add failure rate per test
- Show test status per device in tree view
- FEAT Provide an overview of available screenshots in s source code view
- Fade out "old" tests (where the last run is old and the test has been renamed or deleted)
- Compare steps of failed run with previous successful run
- IDEA Create a notification application which also works on the report data
- Improve error messages by adding the failed step + args to the error message (e. g. element not visible [but which element?])
