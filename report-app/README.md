- ava-codeceptjs: Tag each test run with a unique identifier
- ava-codeceptjs: Automatically retry test on a (different?) device
- ava-codeceptjs: Tag tests as integration test
- Detail View: Rather show list of commands and a big screenshot in a separate pane
- Show last errors on other devices
- Show last change date of test files
- Make mongodb query more efficient
- Cleanup report database regularly
- Mark known failures (use screenshot hashid)

- Do a side by side compare of a failed and successful test run
- Display exact date in details
- Link to test details using hashcategory
- Show screenshot shotAt delta
- Filter by environment
- Filter by device
- exclude known problems from failures (ESOCKETTIMEOUT)
- Improve report file cleanup (keep last successful and all errors)
- Mark same error as current in previous failures
- Refresh page automatically

- Fade out "old" tests (where the last run is old and the test has been renamed or deleted)
- Compare steps of failed run with previous successful run
- IDEA Create a notification application which also works on the report data
- Improve error messages by adding the failed step + args to the error message (e. g. element not visible [but which element?])
