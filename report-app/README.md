## Backlog V 2.1

- Browser console logs: Should highlight errors "with a status of 5xx"
- TestStatus: Show path prefix on feature boxes
- Show relative time on source snippets/screenshots
- Errors: Would be nice to see how often the same error occurred previously in the current test
- TestStatus: Filter by environment
- Test Status: Have a sticky table of contents with the categories and the feature
- report-service: handle error (return http status code) when report does not exist
- TestStatus: Simple search for test title and tags
- TestStatus: Remove last prefix element (since it is the file name (more like scenario name))
- Detect links in error messages
- ATDD Tag: Add ATDDFailed when test fails on other line
- AlertService: Group by device
- AlertService: Trigger hipchat notifications
- Bring back the step outline view
- Create codeceptjs error parser in order to create better error messages (e.g including detailed help texts what went wrong and how to fix)
- Average test duration (across all tests in a project) would be a nice metric
- BUG: Screenshot diff: Screenshot compare must also drill down into stack
- Cleanup Process: Should keep all the errors (up to some point in time) and any previous success
